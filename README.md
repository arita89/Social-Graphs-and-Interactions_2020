# looney_graphs

Final project for the DTU course - Social graphs and interactions (02805) 

## Data
We have used our own data retireval modules, therefore the rawest data we have are .json files, which are on html-fix brnach under "./data/cache/". They are raw request reposnes from API, therefore we encourge the user to use pickled varaibles, with already processed data from .json files. They can be found under "./data/temp/" directory.
